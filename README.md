dotfiles
========
These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these are mine.

INSTALL
-------
Installation is easy
```shell
~$ git clone https://github.com/bobbyrussell/dotfiles.git
~$ cd dotfiles/
~/dotfiles$ chmod +x install.sh
~/dotfiles$ ./install.sh
```
Easy, right?

USAGE

You can manage your files from $HOME/.dotfiles. Files are organized in
directories.

To update the dotfiles after a pull, rerun `install.sh`.
